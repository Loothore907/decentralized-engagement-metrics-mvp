# Decentralized Engagement Metrics MVP

## Introduction

Decentralized Engagement Metrics (DEM) is an innovative approach to quantifying and tokenizing social media engagement, with a particular focus on Twitter (X) interactions. This MVP demonstrates the potential of using multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to analyze and value community engagement in decentralized ecosystems.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a detailed and granular map of social media interactions, enabling projects to make informed decisions based on genuine community engagement. By tokenizing engagement metrics, we aim to transform them into valuable assets for governance and community building.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent RAG system for comprehensive engagement analysis
- Tokenization of engagement metrics (ENG tokens)
- Decentralized data storage and processing
- Integration with existing governance systems
- Customizable engagement metrics for different DAOs and ecosystems

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL
- Twitter API
- Machine Learning libraries (e.g., transformers, sentence-transformers)

## Getting Started

(Include your existing setup and usage instructions here)

## Current Progress

- Implemented basic Twitter data fetching and storage
- Set up PostgreSQL database for storing tweet data
- Created a system for classifying tweet relevance based on project-specific criteria

## Upcoming Functionality

We're always looking to improve and expand our project. Here are some features we're planning to implement in the future:

1. **Explainable AI for Relevance Classification**: 
   - Implement a system that provides human-readable explanations for why a tweet was classified as relevant or not.
   - Create an API endpoint for users to query these explanations.

2. **Multi-Platform Support**: 
   - Extend our data collection and analysis to other social media platforms beyond Twitter.

3. **Real-time Processing**: 
   - Implement a streaming approach for real-time data collection and analysis.

4. **Advanced Engagement Scoring**: 
   - Develop a more sophisticated algorithm for scoring engagement based on multiple factors.

5. **User Dashboard**: 
   - Create a user-friendly interface for viewing engagement metrics and analysis results.

6. **Decentralized Storage Integration**: 
   - Explore options for storing data on decentralized platforms to enhance data resilience and user control.

We welcome contributions in any of these areas! If you're interested in working on one of these features, please check our CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to get involved.
