# Decentralized Engagement Metrics MVP

## Introduction

Decentralized Engagement Metrics (DEM) is an innovative approach to quantifying and tokenizing social media engagement, with a particular focus on Twitter (X) interactions. This MVP demonstrates the potential of using multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to analyze and value community engagement in decentralized ecosystems.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a detailed and granular map of social media interactions, enabling projects to make informed decisions based on genuine community engagement. By tokenizing engagement metrics, we aim to transform them into valuable assets for governance and community building.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent RAG system for comprehensive engagement analysis
- Tokenization of engagement metrics (ENG tokens)
- Decentralized data storage and processing
- Integration with existing governance systems
- Customizable engagement metrics for different DAOs and ecosystems

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.10+
- Machine Learning libraries (e.g., transformers, sentence-transformers)
- Vector Databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or Qdrant)
- Smart Contract Development Tools
- Front-end Technologies for UI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Loothore907/decentralized-engagement-metrics-mvp.git
   cd decentralized-engagement-metrics-mvp
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Twitter API credentials:
     ```
     API_KEY=your_api_key
     API_SECRET_KEY=your_api_secret_key
     ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
     ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
     ```
